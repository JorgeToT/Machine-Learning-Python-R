# Machine Learning with Python and R

* Part 1: Data Preprocessing
  * [Preprocessing](/Part%201%20-%20Data%20Preprocessing/Python/)
    * [Example](/Part%201%20-%20Data%20Preprocessing/Python/data_preprocessing_tools.ipynb)

* Part 2: Regression models
  * [Simple Linear Regression Model](/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%204%20-%20Simple%20Linear%20Regression/Python/)
    * [Example](/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%204%20-%20Simple%20Linear%20Regression/Python/simple_linear_regression.ipynb)
    * Form: $y = \alpha x + \beta$
  * [Multiple Linear Regression Model](/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%205%20-%20Multiple%20Linear%20Regression/Python/)
    * [Example](/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%205%20-%20Multiple%20Linear%20Regression/Python/multiple_linear_regression.ipynb)
    * Form: $y = \alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2 + \alpha_3 x_3 + ... \alpha_n x_n + \beta$
  * [Polynomial Regression Model](/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%206%20-%20Polynomial%20Regression/Python/)
    * [Example](/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%206%20-%20Polynomial%20Regression/Python/polynomial_regression.ipynb)
    * Form: $y = \alpha_1 x + \alpha_2 x^2 + \alpha_3 x^3 + ... + \alpha_n x^n + \beta$
  * [Support Vector Regression (SVG) Model](/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%207%20-%20Support%20Vector%20Regression%20(SVR)/Python)
    * [Example](/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%207%20-%20Support%20Vector%20Regression%20(SVR)/Python/support_vector_regression.ipynb)
    * Like the Linear Regression Model, the SVR model is a linear model that is used to predict the value of a dependent variable as a function of the values of the independent variables. Have $\epsilon$ be the error margin.
  * [Decision Tree Regression Model](/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%208%20-%20Decision%20Tree%20Regression/Python/)
    * [Example](/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%208%20-%20Decision%20Tree%20Regression/Python/decision_tree_regression.ipynb)
  * [Random Forest Regression Model](/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%209%20-%20Random%20Forest%20Regression/Python/)
    * [Example](/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%209%20-%20Random%20Forest%20Regression/Python/random_forest_regression.ipynb)
    * A random forest is a set of decision trees that are used to predict the value of a dependent variable as a function of the values of the independent variables.

* Part 3: Classification models
  * [Logistic Regression Model](/Part%203%20-%20Classification/Section%2014%20-%20Logistic%20Regression/Python/)
    * [Example](/Part%203%20-%20Classification/Section%2014%20-%20Logistic%20Regression/Python/logistic_regression.ipynb)
    * This model provides a classification model with a lineal separator. The lineal separator is a line that separates the two classes of data.
  * [K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Model](/Part%203%20-%20Classification/Section%2015%20-%20K-Nearest%20Neighbors%20(K-NN)/Python)
    * [Example](/Part%203%20-%20Classification/Section%2015%20-%20K-Nearest%20Neighbors%20(K-NN)/Python/k_nearest_neighbors.ipynb)
    * This model calculate the distance between the data and the nearest neighbor. The nearest neighbor is the data point that is closest to the data.
  * [Support Vetor Machine (SVM) Model](/Part%203%20-%20Classification/Section%2016%20-%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20(SVM)/Python)
    * [Example](/Part%203%20-%20Classification/Section%2016%20-%20Support%20Vector%20Machine%20(SVM)/Python/support_vector_machine.ipynb)
    * SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable.
